# Machine Failure Prediction Model

## Overview
This project entails the development of a predictive model to anticipate machine failures using machine learning techniques. The model, built with Keras and TensorFlow, supplemented by scikit-learn, aims to provide accurate forecasts of potential failures, enabling proactive maintenance strategies to minimize downtime and optimize operations.

## Key Features
- Utilizes a Neural Network architecture implemented in Keras to capture complex patterns in machine data.
- Integration of TensorFlow for efficient model training and deployment.
- Incorporates scikit-learn for additional preprocessing and evaluation capabilities.
- Achieved outstanding performance metrics:
  - Validation Set Accuracy: 99.9%
  - Test Set Accuracy: 99.85%

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Ensure that Python and the required libraries (`keras`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`) are installed. You can install them via pip:
   ```
   pip install keras tensorflow scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your machine data in a suitable format. Ensure that it is properly preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **Model Training**: Run the provided script to train the machine failure prediction model:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using the provided evaluation script:
   ```
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

5. **Deployment**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in your production environment to predict machine failures in real-time.
